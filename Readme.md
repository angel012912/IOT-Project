## Description
This project was part of the course "Internet of Things Implementation" where I was asked to develop a web platform capable of displaying and querying data from a SQL database that is constantly adding information from an Arduino that has sensors. With this platform we can keep informed about the state of the environment, so that if the data varies too much, we can know that something is wrong with the environment.

## Main Learnings 
* SQL Language
* HTML/CSS
* PHP
* Teamwork
* Pair programming 
* Arduino Language

## Installation
* Make sure to have already installed XAMPP, if not you can download [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html)
* Download the repository and locate the root directory inside the <code>htdocs</code> directory. 
* In the phpmyadmin interface generate a database named iot
* Now you can acces to <code>localhost/IOT-PROJECT-main/HomePage.php</code>

### Note:
* If you want to view data from your own arduino you has to use the <code>Sensores.ino</code> file on your arduino.
